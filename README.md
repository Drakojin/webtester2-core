> This is the Java 8 optimized version of WebTester (v2.x), for Java 6 and 7 versions see [1.x](https://github.com/testIT-WebTester/webtester-core).

testIT WebTester is a web-application UI test automation framework based on

aims at providing a very intuitive, declarative and extendable API for writing 
programmatic UI tests in Java.

- Simple API for runtime element identification
- Boost reuse with easy composition of pages and page fragments
- Highlighting of used elements for visual debugging
- Custom event handling: from a simple screenshot on exception to custom report generation
- Seamless integration with common frameworks like: AssertJ, Hamcrest, JUnit, Spring, etc.
- Selenium is always just a method call away!

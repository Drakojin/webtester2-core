#Contributing

Firstly, you should create an [issue][5] 
for your enhancement request.

WebTester uses a “Fork & Pull” model for collaborative development. If you have changes that you 
would like us to consider for introduction to WebTester, you will need to fork the repository, 
commit and push your changes to your forked project, and send us a pull request referencing the 
previously created issue.

Please note that, in order to keep WebTester clean and minimal, we consider all enhancement requests 
carefully. Should your enhancement not be appropriate for WebTester, we may reject the pull request.

Before you start, have a look at our [contribution][6] wiki page for important information regarding the development of 
WebTester.

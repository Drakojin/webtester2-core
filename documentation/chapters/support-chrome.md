# Chrome Browser Factory
The module `webtester-support-chrome` provides a default `BrowserFactory` implementation called `ChromeFactory`.

## Additional Service Executable
The 'ChromeDriver' needs an additional executable to communicate with a Chrome browser.
It can be downloaded [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

The path to the executable must be declared as a system or environment property named: `webdriver.chrome.driver`
